## Atom File Manager
This is just a little fun project I'm making. A file manager created with the [atom-shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell).

## Installation
In order to use AtomFM you need to install atom-shell and it must be in your PATH. You can do this manually or just install it globally via npm.
```
npm install -g atom-shell
```

Next just install AtomFM globally and you're good to go!

```
npm install -g atomfm
atomfm
```

Keep in mind that AtomFM is just a test project right now. Nothing is really planned for it and if you'd like to contribute just fork the [repository on github](https://github.com/zaucy/atomfm) and send me a pull request!
